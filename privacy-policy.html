        <h1>Privacy Policy for Water Balloon Chaos</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 12, 2026</p>
        
        <p>Water Balloon Chaos ("the Game") is a casual game developed by Mythic Motion Studios ("we", "us", or "our"). This game is distributed via the Google Play Store and is intended for local use on your device. We respect your privacy and design the Game so that it collects as little information as possible.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal information such as your name, email address, contact details, or precise location.</li>
            <li>The Game does not require you to create an account or sign in.</li>
            <li>The Game does not include advertising SDKs, analytics SDKs, or third-party trackers in its current version.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Local Game Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Game may store basic data locally on your device (for example: settings, volume preferences, or local save data) to improve your experience.</li>
            <li>This data never leaves your device unless you manually back it up or share it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In its current version, the Game does not integrate third-party analytics, ads, social plugins, or other external services that collect personal data.</li>
            <li>If we add such services in future updates (for example, analytics or ads), we will update this Privacy Policy to explain what data is collected, how it is used, and provide links to the respective third-party privacy policies.</li>
            <li>Please note: Google Play Store may collect certain technical information (such as device identifiers and crash logs) in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy. You can learn more at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Game is suitable for a general audience and does not intentionally target or profile children under the age of 13.</li>
            <li>Because we do not collect personal data, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Your Rights and Control</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Because we do not collect or store personal information, there is no personal data related to you that we can provide, modify, or delete.</li>
            <li>You can delete any local game data (such as save files or configuration files) directly from your device at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Game or legal requirements.</li>
            <li>When we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the Game after any changes means you accept the updated policy.</li>
        </ul>
